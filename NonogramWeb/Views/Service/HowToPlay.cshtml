<h1>How to play</h1>

<p>
    Nonograms, also known as Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, and various other names, are picture logic puzzles in which <b>cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.</b>
</p>
<p>
    In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column.
</p>
<p>
    For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets.
</p>
<p>
    These puzzles are black and white describing a binary image.
